# Udacity-Face-Generation-Project

The Jupyter-Notebook-File [dlnd_face_generation.ipynb](dlnd_face_generation.ipynb) includes my
solution to the Face-Generation-Project in the Deeplearning-Nanodegree. 

## General Task and Approach

The task is to construct a neural network that is able to generate images of human faces out
of random vectors.
This task is approached by using a GAN model.
